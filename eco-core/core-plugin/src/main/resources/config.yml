# How player/server data is saved:
# yaml - Stored in data.yml: Good option for single-node servers (i.e. no BungeeCord/Velocity)
# mysql - Standard database, great option for multi-node servers (i.e. BungeeCord/Velocity)
# mongodb - Alternative database, great option for multi-node servers (i.e. BungeeCord/Velocity)
data-handler: yaml

# If data should be migrated automatically when changing data handler.
perform-data-migration: true

mongodb:
  # The full MongoDB connection URL.
  url: ""

  # The name of the database to use.
  database: eco

  # The collection to use for player data.
  collection: profiles

mysql:
  # The table prefix to use for all tables.
  prefix: "eco_"

  # The maximum number of MySQL connections.
  connections: 10

  # Connection details for MySQL.
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: database
  user: username
  password: p4ssw0rd

# How many ticks to wait between committing data to a database. This doesn't
# affect yaml storage, only MySQL and MongoDB. By default, data is committed
# every tick, but you can increase this to be every x ticks, for example 20
# would be committing once a second.
save-interval: 1

# How many ticks to wait between autosaves for data.yml.
autosave-interval: 36000 # 30 minutes

# Options to manage the conflict finder
conflicts:
  whitelist: # Plugins that should never be marked as conflicts

# DropQueue by default uses a faster collated queue system where all drops
# that originate from the same player on the same tick are dropped together.
# Disable it if it changes drop mechanics too much for you.
use-fast-collated-drops: true

# Display frames massively optimize PacketWindowItems, however some users have
# reported display bugs by using it. If you have any problems with it, then you
# should disable this option.
use-display-frame: true

# Time to live for a display frame. In other words, this is how frequent (in ticks)
# that display frames will be cleared / deleted.
display-frame-ttl: 17

# The default bukkit NamespacedKey creation can cause decent amounts of lag under
# load due to the use of regex validation in the constructor. eco has its own system
# to create NamespacedKeys, however it can be unsafe as it skips most validation checks.
# If you encounter any bugs with this, then enable this option - however it will come
# at a performance penalty.
use-safer-namespacedkey-creation: false

# If the stack traces of extensions that failed to load should be logged. Disabled by
# default to prevent users from reporting bugs. Enable if you're a developer.
log-full-extension-errors: false

# To make the custom crafting system work better for players, players are also sent an
# additional recipe containing the displayed items as ingredients. However, with a large
# number of recipes, this can create PacketTooLargeExceptions. If you have this exception,
# disable this option. Bear in mind that this means the auto-craft preview will fail to
# render items nicely, which may degrade the user experience on your server. If you use
# a custom crafting table, though, this won't affect anything, and you should disable the option.
displayed-recipes: true

# If eco plugins should not check for updates; only enable this if you know what you're doing
# as there can be urgent hotfixes that you are then not notified about. If you're confident
# that you can manage updates on your own, turn this on.
no-update-checker: false

# Math expressions are parsed using Crunch, which allows for variables to be used in expressions.
# If this is false, variables will be used to represent placeholders, which leads to fewer
# expression compilations at the expense of slower evaluation times. If this is true, variables
# will instead be translated before compilation to reduce evaluation times at the expense of
# longer compilation times. If your expressions usually contain many variables, then you
# should enable this option as it may improve performance. If you're unsure, leave it disabled.

# If anonymous usage statistics should be tracked. This is very valuable information as it
# helps understand how eco and other plugins are being used by logging player and server
# counts. This is completely anonymous and no personal information is logged. This data
# is primarily used for optimisation and server insights.

# If the packet display system should activate on items that have no meta. This is disabled
# by default for performance reasons, but if you want to use the packet display system on
# items that have no meta, then you can enable this option.

# If eco should enforce its recipes against other plugins. Turn this on if use custom items from
# non eco-based plugins in recipes and are encountering issues with invisible items or similar.
# This may cause issues with other plugins, so only enable this if you're having issues.
