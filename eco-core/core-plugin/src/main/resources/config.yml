# How player/server data is saved:
# yaml - Stored in data.yml: Good option for single-node servers (i.e. no BungeeCord/Velocity)
# mongo - If you're running on a network (Bungee/Velocity), you should use MongoDB if you can.
# mysql - The alternative to MongoDB. Because of how eco data works, MongoDB is the best option; but use this if you can't.
data-handler: yaml

# If data should be migrated automatically when changing data handler.
perform-data-migration: true

mongodb:
  # The full MongoDB connection URL.
  url: ""

mysql:
  # How many threads to execute statements on. Higher numbers can be faster however
  # very high numbers can cause issues with OS configuration. If writes are taking
  # too long, increase this value.
  threads: 2
  # The maximum number of MySQL connections.

# DropQueue by default uses a faster collated queue system where all drops
# that originate from the same player on the same tick are dropped together.
# Disable it if it changes drop mechanics too much for you.
use-fast-collated-drops: true

# Some plugins use their own item display systems (eg Triton)
# And must be run after eco. Don't enable this unless you run a conflicting plugin
# and have been told to enable it.
use-lower-protocollib-priority: false

# Display frames massively optimize PacketWindowItems, however some users have
# reported display bugs by using it. If you have any problems with it, then you
# should disable this option.

# Time to live for a display frame. In other words, this is how frequent (in ticks)
# that display frames will be cleared / deleted.

# The default bukkit NamespacedKey creation can cause decent amounts of lag under
# load due to the use of regex validation in the constructor. eco has its own system
# to create NamespacedKeys, however it can be unsafe as it skips most validation checks.
# If you encounter any bugs with this, then enable this option - however it will come
# at a performance penalty.
use-safer-namespacedkey-creation: false

# If the stack traces of extensions that failed to load should be logged. Disabled by
# default to prevent users from reporting bugs. Enable if you're a developer.
log-full-extension-errors: false

# To make the custom crafting system work better for players, players are also sent an
# additional recipe containing the displayed items as ingredients. However, with a large
# number of recipes, this can create PacketTooLargeExceptions. If you have this exception,
# disable this option. Bear in mind that this means the auto-craft preview will fail to
# render items nicely, which may degrade the user experience on your server. If you use
# a custom crafting table, though, this won't affect anything, and you should disable the option.
displayed-recipes: true

# Save health on leave and set it back on join - works around attribute modifiers.

# If eco plugins should not check for updates; only enable this if you know what you're doing
# as there can be urgent hotfixes that you are then not notified about. If you're confident
# that you can manage updates on your own, turn this on.
