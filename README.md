<h4 align="center">eco - Simplify spigot development.</h4>

# Installation for Development

eco is a standalone plugin, so you will need to install it on any servers that have plugins which depend on it, and specify it as a dependency in your plugin.yml like this:

```yaml
depend: [RedLib]
```

eco is available from any of these places:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Auxilor/eco/releases)
- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eco.87955/)
- [Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/eco.773)
- [Build it locally](https://github.com/Auxilor/eco#build-locally).

## Get from JitPack:

Gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

```

```groovy
dependencies {
        compileOnly 'com.willfp:eco:Tag'
}
```

Replace `Tag` with a release tag for eco, eg `6.0.0`.

Maven:

```xml
<repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>
```

```xml
<dependency>
        <groupId>com.willfp</groupId>
        <artifactId>eco</artifactId>
        <version>Tag</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Replace `Tag` with a release tag for eco, eg `6.0.0`.

## Build locally:

Run the following commands in your terminal of choice.

If you're on windows, you will need to have git bash installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/Auxilor/eco
cd eco
./gradlew build
```
